  <p>I am currently a doctoral candidate in epidemiology at the University of Delaware, supervised by <a target = "blank_" href="https://www.udel.edu/faculty-staff/experts/jennifer-horney/">Jennifer Horney</a>. </p>

  <p>As a doctoral candidate I have extensive research experience in observational data biases and public health, I am starting to search for careers that help foster my curiosity.
    My proposed dissertation, “Common biases in studying the long-term health effects of disasters: challenges & potential solutions,” focuses on identifying the factors that lead to bias in longitudinal disaster epidemiology research.
    I have previously worked in SAS, Python, and R programming languages and have experience generating evidence-based decision support tools for the continuity of business operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

  <p>In 2020, I earned my MPH from Columbia University, where I was mentored by <a target = "blank_" href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/prf1">Pam Factor-Litvak</a>. I also hold an undergraduate degree in biomedical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.</p>

  <p>In summer 2019, during my studies, I consulted at the Ghana Health Service, serving in Gushegu, Northern District. There I conducted an analysis of referral logs and proposed sustainable improvements aimed at increasing the health
directorate’s data capture ability, allowing for future evidence-based interventions.<p>
