<p>I am a self-proclaimed disaster epidemiologist, generally interested in health impacts of natural hazards. More specifically, I focus on how the measurement of these impacts are affected by the currently utilized methodologies. Additionally, I am interested in business continutity through emergence and improvisation, as well as understanding how overall hazard impact may be moderated through household preparedness and the empowerment of children.</p>

<p>I am currently a dotoral student in epidemiology at the University of Delaware, supervised by <a target = "blank_" href="https://www.udel.edu/faculty-staff/experts/jennifer-horney/">Jennifer Horney</a> in the college of Health Sciences. </p>

<p>In 2020, I earned my MPH from Columbia University, where I was mentored by <a target = "blank_" href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/prf1">Pam Factor-Litvak</a>. I also hold an undergraduate degree in biomedical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.</p>

<p>In summer 2019, during my studies, I consulted at the Ghana Health Service, serving in Gushegu, Northern District. There I conducted an analysis of referral logs and proposed sustainable improvements aimed at increasing the health
directorateâ€™s data capture ability, allowing for future evidence-based interventions.<p>
