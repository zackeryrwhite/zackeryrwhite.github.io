  <h2 style="color: #6D91B0;">What is Epidemiology?</h2>
  <p>Epidemiology is the fundamental science of public health, studying the distribution and determinants of health-related events in populations for the purpose of prevention or control.<sup><a target = "blank_" href="https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/index.html">[1]</a></sup></p>

  <h2 style="color: #6D91B0;">What is Disaster?</h2>
  <p>A disaster is a sudden, calamitous event that seriously disrupts the functioning of a community or society and causes human, material, and economic or environmental losses that exceed the community’s or society’s ability to cope using its own resources.<sup><a target = "blank_" href="https://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/what-is-a-disaster/">[2]</a></sup>

  <h2 style="color: #6D91B0;">What is Disaster Epidemiology?</h2>
  <p>Disaster epidemiology is the use of epidemiologic methods to assess the short- and long-term adverse health effects of disasters and to prevent the consequences of future events.<sup><a target = "blank_" href="https://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/what-is-a-disaster/">[2]</a></sup></p>
  <p>Typically, the main objectives of disaster epidemiology are to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>prevent or reduce the number of deaths, illnesses, and injuries caused by disasters,</li>
   <li>provide timely and accurate health information for decision-makers, and </li>
   <li>improve prevention and mitigation strategies for future disasters by gaining information for future response preparation.</li>
  </ul>
